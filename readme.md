# Epic Seven Selected Summon Reroller

Very basic program that rerolls until it finds a summon result with a higher level than the previous best. Used to get the best possible starting characters.

This program is designed to be run with bluestacks at the 1600x900 resolution. It may not work with other programs or resolutions.

When downloading bluestacks it would be very helpful for me if you would use my affiliate link: [Download BlueStacks](https://epic7db.com/bluestacks). When downloading, it will prompt you to install a different game. If you install it, I get a small commission. This is not necessary to use the program, but it is appreciated.

This program will NOT work with the official desktop client as external clicks are not recorded on there.

## Prerequisites

### Installing Python

1. Visit the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system
3. Run the installer
   - Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Verify the installation by opening a command prompt/terminal and typing:
   ```

   ```

### Installing pip

Pip usually comes installed with Python. To verify pip is installed:
1. Open a command prompt/terminal

If pip is not installed, you can install it by:
